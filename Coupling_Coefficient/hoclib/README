Notes on migrating to bglib1.5

-Only mods which are new or have been modified are included in the bglib1.5 branch
--Check out the modlib from the blubrain trunk and replace copy bglib1.5 mods into it

-For the METypePath field in the BlueConfig, the directory referenced should containg the new CCells
--Typically, this can be done by changing the last directory name from 'metypes' to 'CCells'
--e.g. METypePath /bgscratch/bbp/release/29.03.10/CCells

For those who had branched off bglib1.5 earlier, the following files were modified when renaming LoadBalance.hoc to CellDistributor.hoc

Node.hoc
LoadBalance.hoc -> CellDistributor.hoc (with internal edits, too)
Target.hoc
TargetManager.hoc
SynapseRuleManager.hoc


Documentation notes:
In preparation for bglib_1.6, addition of doxygen templates and documentation.
Please define in bglib root directory the following environment variable: BGLIB_ROOT by using export BGLIB_ROOT=$PWD or setenv BGLIB_ROOT $PWD
