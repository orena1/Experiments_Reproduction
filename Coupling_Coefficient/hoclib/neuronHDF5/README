README: Using Neuron to parse NL and have it write an HDF5 file

What you need:

install hdf5-1.6.5.tar.gz:

tar xzvf hdf5-1.6.5.tar.gz
cd into that directory
./configure --prefix=/home/you/hdf5
make
make check
make install



In order to have the hdf5-file generated you need Neuron. If
you execute nrngui in the current directory, everything runs
smoothly. If you want to generate a special, you need to patch
nrnivmodl, nrnmech_makefile to include the -L/home/you/hdf5/lib 
-lhdf5.

For batch processing, I need to add a little script that fills
to_check.tmp from validateASC.


After running nrngui mk_hdf5.hoc you will find the appropirate
.h5 files in the directory.


main.cpp/Makefile are a little C/C++ test program to demonstrate
the readin.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/you/hdf5/lib
